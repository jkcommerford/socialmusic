# socialmusic

This project is intended to provide a simple way for users to add songs to a collaborative queue. It is intended to be used in social settings, allowing anyone to suggest songs.

Potential features:
  "Host Perks": allow the host of the session to set certain restrictions on the queue (i.e., no one can play Justin Beiber ever, disallow    repeat songs, etc)
   "Like/dislike": each user can quickly swipe through the queue and like or dislike songs. A certain nuber of dislikes will remove it from     the list.
